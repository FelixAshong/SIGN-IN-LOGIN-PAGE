      The University of Ghana was founded in 1948 as the University
College of Gold Coast upon the recommendation of the
Asquith Commission on Higher Education in the then British
colonies. Informed by colonial policies, access to higher
education by Africans was limited until the end of World War
II. The founding of the University of Ghana was therefore the
culmination of struggles and protests of nationalist movements
which advocated for an African system of higher education in the
former Gold Coast.
Between 1948 and 1961, the University entered into a special
relationship with the University of London to offer limited
programmes of study. However, by an Act of Parliament on October
1st 1961, the University attained sovereign status with the authority to
offer more comprehensive programmes and award its own degrees.
The University’s sovereign status together with the aspirations of
the new independent state of Ghana formed a catalyst for its rapid
growth in the 1960’s and the emergence of the University of Ghana’s
distinctive identity as a world class centre of academic excellence and
a leader in career training and professional development.
Thus in over six decades, the University of Ghana has evolved into one
of Africa’s leading universities, recognised worldwide for the academic
excellence of its faculty and student body and for the professional success
of its alumni.

            <hr>
              <p>The University of Ghana, the premier university and the largest university in Ghana was founded as the University College of the Gold Coast by Ordinance on August 11, 1948 for the purpose of providing and promoting university education, learning and research. 
                As a University poised to distinguish itself in the area of research to make an impact at the national and international level, the University has launched a new Strategic Plan.
                 <a href="http://www.ug.edu.gh/pad/publication/ug-strategic-plan">Strategic Plan.</a>
                 This new strategic plan (2014-2024) is intended to consolidate the gains made from the review of the University’s mission and practices and situate these within the context of a very dynamic environment of higher education in Ghana and beyond.
                The University of Ghana is a centre of academic
                excellence recognised worldwide for the academic
                excellence of its faculty and student body and for the
                professional success of its alumni.

		  <hr>
        <p>The University of Ghana’s reputation as a centre
          of academic excellence is underpinned by its
          historic commitment to academic rigour, the
          exceptional accomplishment of its faculty and
          impactful research. Consistent with its mission
          of “providing world class human resources and
          capabilities”, the University’s Faculty work at the
          forefront of academia, industry and governance
          providing the needed leadership in research,
          technology, policy and advocacy. The University’s
          academic engagement is diverse and enriching.
          As of the 2013/2014 Academic Year, the University
          managed Memoranda of Understanding,
          Staff/Student Exchange Protocols, and Project
          Agreements with over 180 Universities, Partner
          Institutions and Foundations across the globe.
          In that same Academic Year, the University
          published 1,070 publications and 1,300 research
          projects. So much of what the University stands
          for lies in its ability to fashion strategies and
          solutions to address the broader intractable
          socio-economic challenges facing the world.
          Using its range of expertise, the University
          is actively engaging intellectual and social
          communities in seeking actionable solutions to
          these challenges.</p>

            <hr>
              <p>John Mensah Sarbah (1864-1910) was an illustrious jurist, writer, statesman and the first Gold Coast barrister to be called to the English Bar in 1887. He used his legal acumen to check the excesses of British colonial rule; in particular land appropriations, arguing that land in Africa belonged to the natives and therefore appropriation by the British was illegal. In recognition of championing the course of natives and his contributions towards education, the University named the fifth hall of residence after him in 1960. Until 1991, it was the only mixed hall of residence on Legon campus.

	<h4 class="col-xl-8 offset-xl-2">THE GREAT HALL<hr></h4>
<p class="mb-0">The Great Hall, with a seating capacity of 1,500 and a Tower donated by the Government of Ghana in 1957 to commemorate Ghana’s Independence.Grande auditorium, with vast airspace and very high ceiling. The stage is well set, cool podium, interior decor is antique and professional looking. Surroundings are very neat and well maintained. The seating is a bit hard on the butt though. No air conditioning, but no need for it really, with all that ventilation. The speakers sound great, but give feedback at times. Dual Projectors, one on each side, however, it's still hard to see from the back. When the main hall is full, more people can sit at the surroundings but they usually suffer poor sound and can't see what is projected. Lighting inside is great. Generally a magnificent place, and serves its purpose quite well.<hr></p>

	<h4 class="col-xl-9 offset-xl-1">DIASPORA HOSTELS <hr></h4>
  <p class="mb-0">The Diaspora Halls are also available for freshers to book online. Compared to the traditional halls, the Diaspora Halls have spacious or bigger rooms and each room has its own washroom inside. The washroom facilities are not shared, unlike the traditional halls. This means however that the diaspora halls are more expensive compared to the traditional ones.
	Hilla Limann Hall,
    Alexander Kwapong Hall,
Elizabeth Frances Sey Hall,
Jean Nelson Hall.
You are required to make payments annually and quickly to keep staying in the halls if you want to continue staying there. You can however decide to move to other hostels around legon as well.

For continuing students who wish to seek accommodation at the halls, you would have to contact the various halls to pick up a form to book for a room if there are any.

All students who have been admitted at full-time Legon campus and Korle Bu Campus are required to make residential applications.<hr></p>

          <h3 class="text-center">University of Ghana Required Courses</h3> 
		<hr>
		The University of Ghana’s Required Courses (UGRCs) are
a unique general education programme which is intended
to provide a rewarding experience for all students who
undertake undergraduate studies in the University. The
interdisciplinary courses in the programme are intended
to foster broad student familiarity with key advances in
the humanities, science and technology. It is expected
that these compulsory courses will, in combination with
students’ main areas of study, produce students who are
equipped to meet the development needs of Ghana and
Africa and equip graduates of the University of Ghana to
be confident, rounded scholars capable of holding their
own with graduates from any part of the world.
		<p><strong><em>NB:</strong><b>Details of the semesters in which students of
various colleges are expected to take University Required
Courses may be found in the programme structure for
			each Department/School.</p></em></b>

        <h3 class="text-center">UGRC 110: ACADEMIC WRITING </h3>
        <p>The main objective of Academic Writing I is to equip
students with the language skills that will enable them
to read and write effectively. Students will be taken
initially through fundamental issues in grammar and
composition in order to consolidate their language skills
in these areas. Subsequently, reading and writing skills
relevant to university work will be introduced. These will
include the structure of the essay, unity, completeness
and coherence in essay writing; summarising as a skill
basic to exposition, writing from sources, referencing
skills and avoiding plagiarism. The course will be taught
in small groups and class activities are characterised by
group work,oral presentations and extensive practical
assignments.</p>
		  
		  <h3 class="text-center">UGRC 130: UNDERSTANDING HUMAN SOCIETIES</h3>
        <p>The course is designed for students pursuing sciencerelated
programmes at the undergraduate level. The aim
of the course is to introduce students to the broad array of
issues that shape human societies. The course is divided
into two main parts. Part I seeks to introduce students to
the evolution of human societies, the economic basis of
human societies, and governance in societies. It covers
the first three weeks of lectures and it is compulsory for
all students. Part II covers 10 weeks, and aims to ground
students’ understanding of human societies on six
selected areas, each constituting a module: the economy
and business; culture and development; governance in
the information society; human behaviour and the social
environment; religion and societies; and language in
society. Students are expected to select one out of the six
modules provided.</p>
		  
		  <h3 class="text-center">UGRC 120: NUMERACY SKILLS</h3>
        <p>This course is designed for students to acquire basic
numeracy skills needed for solving real life problems. It
involves the following: review of basic algebraic skills; rates
(fractions, proportions and percentages); approximating
numbers (rounding up of numbers and significant
numbers); mathematical reasoning, (deductive and
inductive reasoning); statements; truth tables; necessary
and sufficient conditions; basic set theory; nature and uses
of statistics; sources of data; data types and measurement
scales; methods of data manipulation (aggregation and
interpretation); basic probability with illustrations from
various disciplines; establishing relationships between
variables, and the use of basic computer packages such
as Excel in analysing data.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">THE ARMS OF THE UNIVERSITY</h3>
        <hr>
      </div>    
  <p>Prior to its attainment of a sovereign university status,
    the motto of the University of Ghana, then known as
    the University College of Gold Coast was <em>“vigil evocat
    auroram” </em> by a cockerel - the watchful bird
    calling forth the dawn, i.e. keeping vigil to protect
    its academic freedom from being eroded through
    political intervention in its affairs.
    In 1961, the University attained a sovereign status and
    by 1963, it was felt that inspiration for its growth could
    best be drawn from Ghana’s cultural roots preserved
    in a new motto and a new crest. To this end, Professor
    A.A Kwapong, the first Ghanaian Pro-Vice Chancellor,
    tasked Professor Manwere Opoku of the Institute of
    African Studies (IAS) to design the crest.
    Professor Opoku chose the symbol of three straight
    ferns (aya in Twi), which because of their quality of
    always growing straight up in the forest represent,
    in traditional thought, straightness, truthfulness,
    integrity. He also took the symbol of two interlocking
    ram horns (in Twi - guanini mmen toa so) which never
    stop growing therefore depicting progress. Professor
    Kwapong then provided the Latin rendering of the
    motto <em>“integri procedamus” </em> with integrity,
    inscribed beneath the symbols.</p>

					  <h3>Sports for Academic Credit</h3>
                    <hr>
  <p>UG encourages and supports its students who spend
their time, energy and resources to train and compete for
honours for the University in particular and the nation as
a whole.<br>
The university has therefore initiated a Sports for Academic
Credit Programme. This is intended to integrate sports
into the academic programme of the University to enable
eligible students earn credits for sports and sport-related
courses, which would count towards their total credits
earned. Students can be considered for sports credit
from their second year based on their previous sports
performance in the University. Enrolment is on the basis
of application to and recommendation from the Sports
Directorate and approved by the appropriate Dean.<br>
Sports performers can earn a maximum of 3 credits per
year on the programme, with a maximum of 6 credits
during their course of study in the University. Courses
under the programme will be graded in accordance with
the University of Ghana’s grading system. Practical and
theory sections will take 50% each of the final grade.

              <h3>The University Campuses</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>The University’s distinctive specialised teaching and
                impactful research is carried across three campus
                communities – Legon Campus, Accra City Campus and
                Korle-Bu Campus.</p>
              <p><strong> Legon Campus(Main Campus)</strong></p>
              Legon comes from two indigenous Ga words: “ni-le”
              which is translated “knowledge” and “gon” which is
              translated as “hill”; thus Legon is the rendering of “nilegon”
              - “hill of knowledge”; aptly describing the 121 metre
              altitude of the Legon Campus.
              Located 13 kilometers northeast of Accra, Legon Campus
              is recognised as the nerve-centre of Ghana’s premier
              academic resource. It houses the central administration
              and the five traditional Halls of the University - Legon,
              Volta, Commonwealth, Akuafo and Mensah Sarbah. Many
              of the academic, residence and support service facilities
              which were commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s have
              undergone renovation and expansion. Recent projects
              include VALCO Trust Hostel (1997) Jubilee Hall (1998),
              International Students Hostels (1999) and Hilla Limann,
              Alexander Adum Kwapong, Jean Nelson Aka (2010) and
              Elizabeth Frances B. Sey Halls (2012).</p>
              <p><strong>Korle Bu Campus</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;The Korle Bu Campus is located 3 kilometres from
                Accra’s Central Business District. It houses the College of
                Health Sciences comprising the School of Medicine and
                Dentistry, School of Public Health, Noguchi Memorial
                Institute for Medical Research, the School of Allied
                Health Sciences, the School of Nursing and the School of
                Pharmacy.
                Affiliated with the College of Health Sciences is the Korle
                Bu Teaching Hospital, the largest teaching hospital
                in Ghana. The stimulating academic experience at
                the Korle Bu Campus is further enriched by three
                centres of excellence: National Cardiothoracic Centre,
                National Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Centre and
                Radiotherapy Centre.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Accra City Campus</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;The Accra City Campus was originally established during
                the 1963/1964 Academic Session as the External Degree
                Centre. Until it was restructured into the Accra City
                Campus in 2002, it was known as the Accra Workers
                College.
                The City Campus offers mature persons and persons
                who prefer not to study full time with access to many of
                the degree programmes available on the main Legon
                Campus. It is located within the Central Business District
                of Accra.</p>
                <p><i><h3>Campus Experience</h3></p>
              <p>&nbsp;Campus experience is an integral part of the University
                of Ghana’s educational experience. It is enriched by
                the diversity of students and faculty across the globe,
                engaging academic and practical assignments,
                recreation and socialisation, vibrant student governance
                and creative networking.
                Residential and non-residential students have ample
                access to the University’s academic resources – colleges
                & schools, lecture halls, libraries and research facilities.
                Students also benefit from an array of non-academic
                resources such as the University Hospital, Postal & banking
                services, eateries, shops, copy centres, sports facilities, free
                wireless internet and many more.</i></p>

              <p><strong>Socio-Political</strong></p>
              The University of Ghana has consistently taken the
              lead on socio-political issues that affect the greater
              well-being of society.
              Through the sustained attention of specialised
              institutes and centres, topical and sometimes
              controversial issues are studied, analysed and brought
              to the attention of sector stakeholders and the public
              domain for debate and redress.
              The Institute for Statistical, Social & Economic
              Research (ISSER) and Legon Centre for International
              Affairs and Diplomacy (LECIAD) are just two of
              the several institutes and centres that are at the
              frontier of socio- political leadership. Whereas ISSER
              is recognised for its authoritative socio-economic
              analysis and reports, LECIAD has built an international
              reputation for the depth and relevance of its timely
              contribution to contemporary discourse, particularly
              those pertaining to Africa. The University also serves
              as an incubator for major associations, clubs, political
              parties, lecture series, symposia and workshops.
              The Annual “New Year’s School” and “Aggrey-
              Fraser-Guggisberg Memorial Lectures”, for instance
              have attracted eminent personalities from diverse
              backgrounds discussing teething issues in leadership
              and governance.
